This is a website to host a p5 project that I just recently learned for my CSCI 201 course. My p5js editor for this repository is [https://editor.p5js.org/crc035/sketches/MqE2eCIKe]. Below is a screenshot of the program. Note that when the actual program runs, the balls are bouncing around and they are changing size and color throughout. I modified Professor Meng's program by making the balls follow a color scheme of pinks, oranges, and yellows; making the color and size of the balls change throughout the program; and changing the audio file to a mp3 of Taylor Swift's "22". This was a fun project to learn the basics of p5js!
